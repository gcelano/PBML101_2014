============
This repository contains all the files which are necessary to reproduce the results I present in the article 
"A computational study on preverbal and postverbal accusative object nouns and pronouns in Ancient Greek" in 
The Prague Bulletin of Mathematical Linguistics 101:97-110

This is the first attempt - as far as I know - to make a linguistic study fully reproducible and verifiable.
